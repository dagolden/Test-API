NAME
    Test::API - Test a list of subroutines provided by a module

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.002.

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::More tests => 2;
         use Test::API;
     
     require_ok( 'My::Package' );
     
     public_ok ( 'My::Package', @names );
     
     import_ok ( 'My::Package',
             export    => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],
             export_ok => [ 'baz', 'bam' ], 
         );

DESCRIPTION
    This simple test module checks the subroutines provided by a module.
    This is useful for confirming a planned API in testing and ensuring that
    other functions aren't unintentionally included via import.

USAGE
    Note: Subroutines in a package starting with an underscore are ignored.
    Therefore, do not include them in any list of expected subroutines.

  public_ok
       public_ok( $package, @names );

    This function checks that all of the @names provided are available
    within the $package namespace and that only these subroutines are
    available. This means that subroutines imported from other modules will
    cause this test to fail unless they are explicitly included in @names.

  import_ok
       import_ok ( $package, %spec );

    This function checks that $package correctly exports an expected list of
    subroutines and only these subroutines. The %spec generally follows the
    style used by Exporter, bun in lower case:

       %spec = (
         export    => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],  # exported automatically
         export_ok => [ 'baz', 'bam' ],  # optional exports
       );

    For "export_ok", the test will check for public functions not listed in
    "export" or "export_ok" that can be imported and will fail if any are
    found.
