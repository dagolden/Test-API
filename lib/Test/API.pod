=head1 NAME

Test::API - Test a list of subroutines provided by a module

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Test::More tests => 2;
     use Test::API;
 
     require_ok( 'My::Package' );
 
     public_ok ( 'My::Package', @names );
 
     import_ok ( 'My::Package',
         export    => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],
         export_ok => [ 'baz', 'bam' ], 
     );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This simple test module checks the subroutines provided by a module.  This is
useful for confirming a planned API in testing and ensuring that other
functions aren't unintentionally included via import.

=head1 USAGE

Note: Subroutines in a package starting with an underscore are ignored.
Therefore, do not include them in any list of expected subroutines.

=head2 public_ok

   public_ok( $package, @names );

This function checks that all of the C<<< @names >>> provided are available within the
C<<< $package >>> namespace and that B<only> these subroutines are available.  This
means that subroutines imported from other modules will cause this test to fail
unless they are explicitly included in C<<< @names >>>.

=head2 import_ok

   import_ok ( $package, %spec );

This function checks that C<<< $package >>> correctly exports an expected list of
subroutines and B<only> these subroutines.  The C<<< %spec >>> generally follows 
the style used by L<Exporter>, bun in lower case:  

   %spec = (
     export    => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],  # exported automatically
     export_ok => [ 'baz', 'bam' ],  # optional exports
   );

For C<<< export_ok >>>, the test will check for public functions not listed in
C<<< export >>> or C<<< export_ok >>> that can be imported and will fail if any are found.
